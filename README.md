# ‚úÖ MODULE: Installation & Configuration

> [!WARNING]
> **DON'T SKIP ANY PART OF THIS README.md & please don't raise pointless Issues - thank you!**

## üìã 1. PREP: Upload & Configure the Module

**First, read the above System Requirements, and resolve any blockers to using Proxmox VE for WHMCS.**

### üë• PVE: User x2 Requirement (API & VNC users)

#### Credentials: root account for each PVE host

**You must have a root account to use the Module at all.** Configured via WHMCS > Servers.

This is configured in the pam realm. We may allow overriding in v1.3.x/v1.4.x. #117

#### Credentials: VNC user for Console Access only

Additionally, to improve security, for VNC you must also have a Restricted User. 

Configured in the _Module_ as detailed below, once you've added/restricted it in PVE.

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è INSTALL: Getting ready to use the Module!

First up, get the basics sorted out:

0. Upload the Module to your WHMCS installation, ensuring correct permissions/ownership.
1. Activate it via WHMCS > Addon Modules > Proxmox VE for WHMCS > Activate.
2. In the same spot post-activation, expose the Module to Administrators.
3. Make sure your Proxmox host has a valid SSL Certificate installed.
4. Ensure you've TCP/8006 connectivity between WHMCS & PVE.

Once you've done all of that, in order to get the module working properly, you need to:

0. Proxmox VE > Create an additional VNC-only user, per instructions below
1. WHMCS Admin > Config > Servers > Add (Advanced) > PVE Host/s (User: `root`; IPv4: `PVE's`; no port suffix!)
2. WHMCS Admin > Addons > Proxmox VE for WHMCS > Module Config > VNC Secret (see below)
3. WHMCS Admin > Addons > Proxmox VE for WHMCS > Add QEMU/LXC Plan/s
4. WHMCS Admin > Addons > Proxmox VE for WHMCS > Add an IPv4 Pool
5. WHMCS Admin > Config > Products/Services > New Service (create offering)
6. " " > Newly-added Service > Tab 3 > **SAVE** (links Module Plan to WHMCS Service type)
7. (Optional) WHMCS Admin > Addons > Proxmox VE for WHMCS > Import Guest

#### Admin GUI: QEMU Plan Creation interface

<img alt="Plan Creation GUI for adding a new QEMU VM Plan" src="zQEMUplanAdd.png">

## ü•Ω 2. noVNC: Console Tunnel (Client Area)

After forking the module, we considered how to improve security of Console Tunneling via WHMCS. We decided to implement a routing method which uses a secondary user in Proxmox VE with very restrictive permissions. 

This is due to be re-built again in 2026 to further enhance security.

### How to offer VNC via WHMCS Client Area!

1. Install & configure the module properly
2. Follow the PVE User Requirement info below
3. Routed IPv4 for PVE (or TLS-proxy to LAN)
4. PVE and WHMCS on the same 1x Domain Name*
5. Have valid PTR/rDNS set on the PVE Address

**If proxying, that is your sole responsibility to configure & diagnose.**

Otherwise, PVE must be WAN-accessible and all other configs/reqs satisfied.

### Creating the VNC User within Proxmox VE

1. Create User Group "VNC" via PVE > ` Datacenter / Permissions / Group`
2. Create new User "vnc" > `Datacenter / Permissions / Users` - Group: "VNC", Realm: pve
3. Create new Role -> `Datacenter / Permissions / Roles` - Name: "VNC", Privileges: VM.Console (only)
4. Permit VNC Access -> `Datacenter / Permissions / Add Group Permissions` - Group: "VNC", Role: "VNC"
5. WHMCS > Modules > Proxmox VE for WHMCS > Module Config > VNC Secret = 'vnc' password (PVE) you set

> [!CAUTION]
> Do NOT set less restrictive permissions. The above is designed for interim security.
> 
> **However, if you wish for proper security: wait for VNC to be further improved.**
> 
> Note: Custom WHMCS locations like /clients/ are not yet VNC-supported. #114

### Important info about Console Access

**noVNC has been overhauled. It isn't guaranteed, nor the project at all. :-)**

- Note #0 = PVE must be at an IPv4 which has PTR the exact same as PVE's hostname.
- Note #1 = You must use different Subdomains on the 1x Domain Name, for the cookie (anti-CSRF).
- Note #2 = If your Domain Name has a 2-part TLD (ie. co.uk) then you will need to fork & amend `novnc_router.php` - ideally we/someone will optimise this down the track.
- Note #3 = You must configure a VNC Secret in the Module Settings, after creating it in PVE.
- Note #4 = You must have a stable and "relatively" static IPv4 fixed/routed WAN address for each PVE host. **CGNAT, Cellular & other "fast DHCP" style configurations cannot be worked with due to a variety of external network issues.**

## üåê 3. Networking: IPv4 Pools, IPv6, vmbr/SDN

### IPv4: Pool required for assignment

Please make sure you create an IPv4 Pool with sufficient scope/size to be able to deploy addresses within it to your guest VMs and CTs. Else it won't be able to create a Service for you.

**Private IPs for PVE Hosts:** Note that VNC may be problematic without work due to the strict requirements introduced in Proxmox v8.0 (strict same-site attribute). Just as SSL/TLS Certificates are no longer trusted for Public IP Addresses, there is increasing work to make the web secure-by-default which makes VNC/etc safer. Hence, we will not support any set-ups which do not follow the set-up processes 100%.

**Guest Imports from PVE (existing):** Take note that during the Guest Import process, there is no association ensured to an IP Pool, rather we take your inputs and use them verbatim due to existing/current nature of the Guest's configuration.

### IPv6: SLAAC default, via 2nd vNIC

Available options: 
- SLAAC (2nd vNIC)
- DHCP (2nd vNIC)
- off (v4-only)

You may add different config via PVE/`pvesh` manually of course, if you need to specify a prefix etc.

### vmbr / SDN: Config type

This depends on your configuration on the PVE Host/s - bridge (vmbr0 etc) or software-defined (SDN).

- **If normal (bridged)** - use `vmbr` as the Network, then use `0` as the Interface ID - this makes up `vmbr0`.
- **If SDN (Software Defined Network)** - use SDN Name for Network, leave Interface ID blank (= no suffix).

## ‚öôÔ∏è 4. VM/CT PLANS: Setting everything up

These steps explain the unique requirements for QEMU & LXC guests.

**Custom Fields:** Values need to go in Name & Select Options.<br>
This needs configuring for each `WHMCS Admin > Products & Services` entry.

### VM Option 1: QEMU, PVE Template VM Clone

Firstly, create the Template VM in PVE. You need its unique PVE ID.

Use that ID in the Custom Field `KVMTemplate`, as in `ID|Name`.

> Note: `ID` is the Unique ID that your Template VM has in PVE.<br>
> Note: `Name` is what will be displayed to your Clients in WHMCS.

### VM Option 2: QEMU, WHMCS Plan + PVE ISO

Firstly, create the Plan in WHMCS Module. Then too in WHMCS Config > Services.

> Under the Service, you need to add a Custom Field `ISO` with the full location.<br>
> This ISO must be located on the PVE Host, and not on the WHMCS installation side.

### CT Option 1: LXC, PVE Template File

Firstly, store the Template in PVE. You need its storage, folder & File Name.

> Use that prefixed file name in the Custom Field `Template`, as in:<br>
> `local:vztmpl/ubuntu-99.99-standard_amd64.tar.gz|Ubuntu 99`

### VM/CT Import/Associate Existing Guest

You can associate an existing PVE Guest through the WHMCS Module too, like this:

<img alt="Importing GUI for linking to existing PVE Guest" src="zVMIDimport.png">

Note: All module-imported services need to be checked and amended to ensure configs such as Billing Cycle, Price, Discount, Assigned IPs, NS1/2, etc, are properly set.

#### ZFS etc: Comfigure to suit isolated TPLs

- `local` is the name of the file-system that you have the Template on
- `vztmpl` is the directoty name per convention, with the ISO within
- `ubuntu-99.99-...` etc is the Template file name, exactly as-is

**If using ZFS for Templates, substitute `local` with the volume name.**

#### Password: Configure the CT's root user

Create a 2nd Custom Field `Password` for the Container's root user on all CT Services.

## üîÑ 5. PATCH: Updating the Module

**Check:** `WHMCS Admin > Addon Modules > Proxmox VE for WHMCS > Support/Health`

You should download any new version & upload it over the top, then login to WHMCS Admin.

Logging in should trigger the self-upgrade procedure for the SQL database.

(**Beta in v1.2.x:** for now, verify yourself that updates were successful)

### SQL: Keeping your DB up-to-date

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Since v1.3.0, logging into WHMCS Admin & opening the module should run any needed SQL Ops.
> 
> v1.2.9 & below, consult the **UPDATE-SQL.md** file, open your SQL DB & run statements. 

Then you're done with each update!

_Note: db.sql file contains new tables for v1.3.x releases_
