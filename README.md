# üéØ MODULE: System Requirements (PVE/WHMCS)

## WHMCS must have >100 services!

New Biz: Fresh Installations/Businesses using WHMCS need to take note of the Service ID <100 case.

**SID >100:** The WHMCS Service ID requirement is CRITICAL, as **Proxmox reserves VMIDs <100 (system).** 

_If you don't have enough services (of any status) in WHMCS (DB: tblhosting.id), create enough dummy/test entries to reach Service ID 101+._ **Else you're likely to see an error which explains this:** 

`HTTP/1.1 400 Parameter verification failed. (invalid format - value does not look like a valid VM ID)`

To check, browse to your **latest** service in WHMCS, then check the URL - it will reveal the Service ID. If it is less than 100, subtract it from 100 to deduce how many "dummy services" you need to add in a dummy order. 

**Once over 100, it fits the requirement & you're good!**

## General Requirements

- **(WHMCS)** v8.x.x stable (HTTPS)
- **(WHMCS)** **Service ID above 100**
- **(NET)** WAN Access: WHMCS to PVE
- **(VNC)** Special Requirements: PTR, etc.
- **(PHP)** v8.x.x (latest stable version)
- **(PHP)** max_execution_time = 300
- **(Proxmox)** 2 users (API & VNC)
- **(Proxmox)** VE v8.x.x (current)

# ‚úÖ MODULE: Installation & Configuration

**DON'T SKIP ANY PART OF THIS README.md - please don't raise pointless Issues - thank you!**

## üìã 1. PREP: Upload & Configure the Module

Check the System Requirements above, and resolve any blockers to using Proxmox VE for WHMCS.

### üë• PVE: User x2 Requirement (API & VNC users)

#### Credentials: root account for each PVE host

**You must have a root account to use the Module at all.** Configured via WHMCS > Servers.

This is configured in the pam realm. We plan to allow selection in v1.2.9.

#### Credentials: VNC user for Console Access only

Additionally, to improve security, for VNC you must also have a Restricted User. 

Configured in the _Module_ as detailed below, once you've added/restricted it in PVE.

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è INSTALL: Getting ready to use the Module!

First up, get the basics sorted out:

0. Upload the Module to your WHMCS installation, ensuring correct permissions/ownership.
1. Activate it via WHMCS > Addon Modules > Proxmox VE for WHMCS > Activate.
2. In the same spot post-activation, expose the Module to Administrators.
3. Make sure your Proxmox host has a valid SSL Certificate installed.
4. Ensure you've TCP/8006 connectivity between WHMCS & PVE.

Once you've done all of that, in order to get the module working properly, you need to:

0. Proxmox VE > Create an additional VNC-only user, per instructions below
1. WHMCS Admin > Config > Servers > Add (Advanced) > PVE Host/s (User: `root`; IPv4: `PVE's`; no port suffix!)
2. WHMCS Admin > Addons > Proxmox VE for WHMCS > Module Config > VNC Secret (see below)
3. WHMCS Admin > Addons > Proxmox VE for WHMCS > Add KVM/LXC Plan/s
4. WHMCS Admin > Addons > Proxmox VE for WHMCS > Add an IPv4 Pool
5. WHMCS Admin > Config > Products/Services > New Service (create offering)
6. " " > Newly-added Service > Tab 3 > **SAVE** (links Module Plan to WHMCS Service type)

## ü•Ω 2. noVNC: Console Tunnel (Client Area)

After forking the module, we considered how to improve security of Console Tunneling via WHMCS. We decided to implement a routing method which uses a secondary user in Proxmox VE with very restrictive permissions. 

This is due to be re-built again to further enhance security.

### How to offer VNC via WHMCS Client Area

1. Install & configure the module properly
2. Follow the PVE User Requirement info below
3. Public IPv4 for PVE (or proxy to private)
4. PVE and WHMCS on the same Domain Name*
5. Have valid PTR/rDNS for the PVE Address

If proxying, that is your responsibility to diagnose.

Else, PVE must be WAN-accessible and all other configs/reqs satisfied.

### Creating the VNC User within Proxmox VE

1. Create User Group "VNC" via PVE > ` Datacenter / Permissions / Group`
2. Create new User "vnc" > `Datacenter / Permissions / Users` - Group: "VNC", Realm: pve
3. Create new Role -> `Datacenter / Permissions / Roles` - Name: "VNC", Privileges: VM.Console (only)
4. Permit VNC Access -> `Datacenter / Permissions / Add Group Permissions` - Group: "VNC", Role: "VNC"
5. WHMCS > Modules > Proxmox VE for WHMCS > Module Config > VNC Secret = 'vnc' password (PVE) you set

> Do NOT set less restrictive permissions. The above is designed for hypervisor security.
> 
> **However, if you wish for proper security, wait for VNC to be further improved.**

### Important info about Console Access

noVNC has been overhauled. It isn't guaranteed, nor the project at all. :-)

- Note #1 = You must use different Subdomains on the same Domain Name, for the cookie (anti-CSRF).
- Note #2 = If your Domain Name has a 2-part TLD (ie. co.uk) then you will need to fork & amend `novnc_router.php` - ideally we/someone will optimise this to better cater to all formats.

## üåê 3. Networking: IPv4 Pools, IPv6, vmbr/SDN

### IPv4: Pool required for assignment

Please make sure you create an IP Pool with sufficient scope/size to be able to deploy addresses within it to your guest VMs and CTs. Else it won't be able to create a Service for you.

**Private IPs for PVE Hosts:** Note that VNC may be problematic without work due to the strict requirements introduced in Proxmox v8.0 (strict same-site attribute).

### IPv6: SLAAC default, 2nd vNIC

Per The-Network-Crew/Proxmox-VE-for-WHMCS#33 there's SLAAC/DHCP/off available (2x vNICs) (May 2024).

You can of course add different config via PVE/`pvesh` manually, if you need to specify a prefix.

### vmbr / SDN: Config type

This depends on your configuration on the PVE Host/s - bridge (vmbr0 etc) or software-defined (SDN).

**If normal (bridged)** - use `vmbr` as the Network, then use `0` as the Interface ID - this makes up `vmbr0`.

**If SDN (Software Defined Network)** - use SDN Name for Network, leave Interface ID blank (= no suffix).

## ‚öôÔ∏è 4. VM/CT PLANS: Setting everything up

These steps explain the unique requirements for QEMU & LXC guests.

**Custom Fields:** Values need to go in Name & Select Options.<br>
This needs configuring for each `WHMCS Admin > Products & Services` entry.

### VM Option 1: QEMU, PVE Template VM Clone

Firstly, create the Template VM in PVE. You need its unique PVE ID.

Use that ID in the Custom Field `KVMTemplate`, as in `ID|Name`.

> Note: `ID` is the Unique ID that your Template VM has in PVE.<br>
> Note: `Name` is what will be displayed to your Clients in WHMCS.

### VM Option 2: QEMU, WHMCS Plan + PVE ISO

Firstly, create the Plan in WHMCS Module. Then, WHMCS Config > Services.

> Under the Service, you need to add a Custom Field `ISO` with the full location.<br>
> This ISO must be located on the PVE Host, and not on the WHMCS installation side.

### CT Option 1: LXC, PVE Template File

Firstly, store the Template in PVE. You need its storage, folder & File Name.

> Use that prefixed file name in the Custom Field `Template`, as in:<br>
> `local:vztmpl/ubuntu-99.99-standard_amd64.tar.gz|Ubuntu 99`

#### ZFS etc: Comfigure to suit isolated TPL

- `local` is the name of the file-system that you have the Template on
- `vztmpl` is the directoty name per convention, with the ISO within
- `ubuntu-99.99-...` etc is the Template file name, exactly as-is

ie. If using ZFS for Templates, substitute local with volume name.

#### Password: Configure the CT's root user

Make a 2nd Custom Field `Password` for the CT's root user.

## üîÑ 5. PATCH: Updating the Module

**Check:** `WHMCS Admin > Addon Modules > Proxmox VE for WHMCS > Support/Health`

You should download any new version & upload it over the top, then run any needed SQL queries.

### SQL: Keeping your DB up-to-date

Please consult the **UPDATE-SQL.md** file, open your WHMCS DB & run the statements. 

Then you're done with each update! Not all versions need database amendments.

1. The Wiki.
2. The README.md.
3. Open GitHub Issues on the repo.
4. HTTP, PHP, WHMCS & debug logs (see below).
5. PVE logs; best practices; network; etc.
